### Testing

We maintain high test coverage. Please add tests for any new functionality:

```bash
# Run all tests
cargo test

# Run tests with output
cargo test -- --nocapture

# Run specific test
cargo test test_partial_parser

# Run integration tests only
cargo test --test integration_test

# Check test coverage (requires cargo-tarpaulin)
cargo tarpaulin --out Html
```

### Code Style

We use standard Rust formatting and linting:

```bash
# Format code
cargo fmt

# Check formatting
cargo fmt -- --check

# Run clippy for linting
cargo clippy -- -D warnings

# Fix clippy suggestions
cargo clippy --fix
```
